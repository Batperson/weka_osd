# Weka OSD

An open source full colour OSD project. Please see the project blog at https://wekaosd.home.blog.

This is currently a proof of concept which drives my Video Experimenter's Board, superimposing colour text and graphics over a live video feed. It is intended to become a full-fledged OSD system for multicopters and other remote-controlled air vehicles.

Ultimately I want to support all of these features:
* A wide range of selectable widgets and instruments
* Augmented reality (skygates, virtual runways, visual cues for other vehicles or POI)
* Audio, for variometer or alert signals
* Up to 3 switchable camera inputs
* VBI data channel for telemetry
* Support for a range of flight controllers, or GPS-only

Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
